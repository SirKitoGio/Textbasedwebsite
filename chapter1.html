        <h1>Chapter 1: What is Multimedia?</h1>
        
        <p>In the context of this review, <strong>Multimedia</strong> is defined as any combination of text, art, sound, animation, and video delivered to you by computer or other electronic or digitally manipulated means.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Key Concept:</strong> When you weave together these elements, you can "electrify the thought processes of people’s minds" by engaging multiple senses simultaneously.
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Multimedia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interactive Multimedia:</strong> A system where the user is given the option of controlling what and when the elements are delivered.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypermedia:</strong> A combination of hypertext, graphics, audio, video, and interactivity resulting in a non-linear experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Project:</strong> A project that is not interactive; it starts at the beginning and runs to the end (e.g., a cinema movie).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Linear Project:</strong> An interactive project where users have navigational control over the content (e.g., games, courseware).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Five Core Elements</h2>
        <p>Multimedia projects are built using five fundamental building blocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text:</strong> The most basic element used for content, menus, and navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphic:</strong> Two-dimensional figures or illustrations that can be produced manually or via computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Produced by vibration and perceived by hearing; includes speech, sound effects, and music scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Animation:</strong> The illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of static images.</li>
            <li><strong>Video:</strong> The technology of capturing and reconstructing moving pictures, typically involving photo-realistic live recordings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Multimedia Development & Technology</h2>
        <h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
        <p>To bring these elements together, developers use <strong>Authoring Tools</strong>. This software is used to merge individual multimedia elements into a cohesive project and manage user interaction.</p>

        <h3>Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>
        <p>Virtual Reality is an extension of multimedia that uses goggles or helmets to place the user "inside" a lifelike experience, creating an immersive 3D environment.</p>

        <h2>Common Multimedia Products</h2>
        <p>Multimedia is often packaged into specific formats based on their use case:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Briefing Products:</strong> Small, straightforward, linear products used to present information quickly and concisely.</li>
            <li><strong>Kiosk Products:</strong> Products stationed in public places that allow users to find information or perform transactions interactively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Multimedia Delivery</h2>
        <p>Multimedia projects can be delivered in two primary ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Offline:</strong> Via storage media like CD-ROM or DVD.</li>
            <li><strong>Online:</strong> Over the World Wide Web (using HTML!).</li>
        </ol>
